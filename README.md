Sir/Ma'am 
<br>
As you can see, I've already submitted all files on time, but just before class I rearranged all files into a single folder so, it is easier to see all files, pdf, source codes. All assignment sumition can be found on the same github link.

Note: Click on assignment 1 folder to access the PDF for this assignment which container all outputs and observations. Also, you won't be able to see the content of the PDF in the github itself, so you have to download it.
